Laboration 3 made by Christoffer Rova and Jonas Roininen.

The concept for our game is a turnbased strategy game where you, as the player, get a Player ID from the server.
The player can put Armour Points on different body parts on his character.

When the player is done putting 10 armor points on his character, on the different body parts,

He will connect to another player, looking for a fight.

Each player takes a turn, clicking the opponents body part, rolling a D6 (six sided-dice) for damage caused on that body part.
The player who guesses the other player's weakpoints and defeats him, becomes the winner.




We firstly based our program of the "Knock knock" example from Oracles network example:
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/sockets/clientServer.html

and modified accordingly.
The vision of our project has not been fullfilled at the moment due to lack of time.

but hopefully we will get it done by tuesday.


Currently, you can connect to the server and get an unique ID from the server,
so the connection is there, we create threads for each client... but the gameplay is
not available.

If you run:

- server/Server.java as it is.
and
- client/Main.java

You will be promted with the GUI, an input where you write the server's ip and port to connect to it.


It will give the client an ID and wait for keyboard inputs due to the: "Knock knock" example.

This is something we hope to fix bofore the review.



With that in mind, this is the URL for our project:
